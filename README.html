    <p>The <a href="https://github.com/OfficeChromatography/autoTLCMS.git">autoTLCMS interface</a> was upgraded with a new 3D printed
plate holder designed to fit all common plate formats in high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC).
A board modification enabled the fully automated hyphenation of HPTLC and HPLC with MS detection, when the
autoTLC-LC-MS interface is a new autosampler for LC-MS.</p>
    <p>Additionally, the formerly used <a href="https://github.com/OfficeChromatography/OC_manager">OC_manager software</a> was trimmed
by deleting files and folders not used for autoTLC-MS2 and by updating the scripts, now called <a href="https://github.com/OfficeChromatography/TLC-MS_manager">TLC-MS_manager</a>.</p>
    <p>Distinct software instructions are now on-line available under the 'Read me' tab of the software.</p>
    <p>The new 3D printed parts are in the folder 'Construction Set'.</p>
    <p>The recently introduced Raspberry Pi 4B with 4 GB or 8 GB RAM is a rather powerful PC, why the TLC-MS_manager also
perfectly runs on this system much cheaper than the NUC-Mini-PC <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/rcm.8631">formerly used</a>.</p>
