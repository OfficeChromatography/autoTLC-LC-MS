# autoTLC-LC-MS

The [autoTLCMS interface](https://github.com/OfficeChromatography/autoTLCMS.git) was upgraded with a new 3D printed 
plate holder designed to fit all common plate formats in high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC). 
A board modification enabled the fully automated hyphenation of HPTLC and HPLC with MS detection, when the 
autoTLC-LC-MS interface is a new autosampler for LC-MS. 


Additionally, the formerly used [OC_manager software](https://github.com/OfficeChromatography/OC_manager) was trimmed 
by deleting files and folders not used for autoTLC-MS2 and by updating the scripts, now called [TLC-MS_manager](https://github.com/OfficeChromatography/TLC-MS_manager). 

Distinct software instructions are now on-line available under the 'Read me' tab of the software.

The new 3D printed parts are in the folder 'Construction Set'.

The recently introduced Raspberry Pi 4B with 4 GB or 8 GB RAM is a rather powerful PC, why the TLC-MS_manager also 
perfectly runs on this system much cheaper than the NUC-Mini-PC [formerly used](https://doi.org/10.1002/rcm.8631).
